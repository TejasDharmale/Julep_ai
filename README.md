# Julep_ai

## Project Overview
Julep_ai is a Flask-based web application that provides AI-powered food recommendations based on user preferences and city data. It integrates with APIs and models such as Julep, DeepSeek, and Llama to deliver personalized suggestions. The app features a modular codebase, a simple UI, and uses environment variables for configuration.

## AI Models Used

#### Why Llama?

Llama is the core large language model (LLM) that powers our intelligent foodie recommendation engine. It's used to understand user preferences, analyze today's weather, and suggest indoor or outdoor dining options. It also personalizes the experience with city-specific food narratives.

#### How We Use Llama

1. **Weather Analysis**  
   Llama evaluates the current weather (sunny, rainy, etc.) for a given city and recommends indoor or outdoor dining accordingly.

2. **Dish Selection**  
   It suggests 3 iconic dishes that represent the local flavor of the selected city.

3. **Restaurant Recommendation**  
   Using Llama's language understanding, it picks top-rated restaurants serving those dishes, based on external data sources or user prompts.

4. **Foodie Tour Generation**  
   Finally, Llama creates a one-day "foodie tour" itinerary with rich breakfast, lunch, and dinner descriptions that adapt to weather conditions and city specialties.

This enables a seamless, intelligent, and highly personalized culinary journey for users.

### DeepSeek
- **Why:**  
  DeepSeek is used for extracting structured information (like city names) from user input.
- **How:**  
  When a user mentions a city or location, DeepSeek accurately identifies and extracts this information, ensuring that recommendations are specific to the userâ€™s intended location.

## Major Features
- Flask web server with static and template directories
- Integration with Julep API and other AI models
- Modular code for user, city, and recommendation handling
- Environment variable support for API keys and configuration
- Basic UI for adding cities and viewing recommendations

## Missing Features / Areas for Improvement
- **Sensitive Data Security:** `.env` was previously committed, exposing API keys. Keys should be rotated and `.env` must be in `.gitignore`.
- **User Authentication:** No login or user management yet.
- **Database Integration:** Data is stored in JSON files, not a scalable database.
- **Error Handling:** Limited input validation and error management.
- **Automated Testing:** No unit or integration tests.
- **Deployment:** No Dockerfile or deployment instructions.

## Unique Feature: Personalized Recommendation History

**Description:**  
Users can log in and view a history of all their past food recommendations, including the cities and restaurants suggested. They can also rate previous recommendations, helping the system improve future suggestions.

**How to Use:**
1. Register or log in to your account.
2. Use the app to get food recommendations as usual.
3. Click on the "My History" link in the navigation bar to view your past recommendations and provide feedback.

**How It Works:**
- Each time you receive a recommendation, it is saved to your personal history.
- You can revisit and rate previous recommendations, making your experience more personalized.

**Planned Implementation:**
- Add user authentication with Flask-Login.
- Store recommendation history in a database (e.g., SQLite).
- Create a `/history` route and template to display the user's history.
- Allow users to rate and comment on past recommendations.

*This feature will make the app more engaging and tailored to each user!*
